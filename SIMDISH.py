"""
Chef has just found a recipe book, where every dish consists of exactly four ingredients. He is going 
to choose some two dishes and prepare them for dinner. Of course, he likes diversity and wants to know 
whether the two dishes are similar.

Two dishes are called similar if at least half of their ingredients are the same. In other words, at 
least two of four ingredients of the first dish should also be present in the second dish. The order of 
ingredients doesn't matter.

Your task is to examine T pairs of dishes. For each pair, check if the two dishes are similar and 
print "similar" or "dissimilar" accordingly.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains four distinct strings, denoting ingredients needed for the 
first dish. Each ingredient is represented by a string of length between 2 and 10 inclusive, consisting 
of lowercase English letters.

The second line of each test case describes the second dish in the same format.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer â€” "similar" if at least half of the 
ingredients are same, and "dissimilar" otherwise (without the quotes).

Example

Input:
5
eggs sugar flour salt
sugar eggs milk flour
aa ab ac ad
ac ad ae af
cookies sugar grass lemon
lemon meat chili wood
one two three four
one two three four
gibberish jibberish lalalalala popopopopo
jibberisz gibberisz popopopopu lalalalalu

Output:
